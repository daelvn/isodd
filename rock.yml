  summary: The latest scientific breakthroughs in the field of odd numbers.
  detailed: >
    The fastest odd-checking module around. Nothing can compete. This is simply
    the best module. It's so cool. It tells you all about odd numbers, like whether
    the number is odd or not (there isn't much more to odd numbers). Optimized
    to hell and back. Integrates with web services. A true challenged to the homonym
    npm module. Just install it. Come on. Install it. Now. Do it.
