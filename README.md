# isodd

Do you struggle telling apart the odd numbers from the filthy evens? Are you a devout follower of the latest innovations in tech? Do you find 15 second loading times normal? Are you reading this with a commercial voice? Then this is the right library for you!

ISODD:tm: uses the ***LATEST*** \[innovations\](link or sth idk man) in the field of odd numbers. Every number EVER is stored INDIVIDUALLY to give blazing FAST results, IMMEDIATELY. RIGHT NOW. INSTANTLY. It integrates with WEB TECHNOLOGY that everybody loves to bring you the GREATEST POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE in the field of ODD NUMBERS. Everything is simply BLEEDING EDGE. Not even Google or NASA can come up with a library like this. This is the library of GODS. 

Nevermind using even number libraries. THIS is the library for you. THIS is the library of freedom and knowledge. If Socrates were alive? He'd be using this library. Einstein used this library. Your mom used this library. Everyone loves this library!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is simply the best library for checking odd numbers there is out there. Have you ever seen another one? NO! Because this is the best and literally nobody has ever felt the need to replace this library because we ARE THE BEST. SIMPLY THE BEST (DUN DUN DUN DUN).

IT'S JUST SIMPLY SO EXCITING. SO INCREDIBLE. SO REVOLUTIONARY. THIS LIBRARY WAS THERE WHEN I NEEDED SOMEONE BY MY SIDE. THIS LIBRARY CURED MY DEPRESSION. WHEN I FEEL ALONE AT NIGHT I JUST THINK ABOUT ISODD:tm: AND ALL MY SADNESS IS GONE. ISODD:tm: IS ALL I NEED. ISODD:tm: IS ALL EVERYONE NEEDS.

LET'S SEE WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS:

> is-od [SIC] is a super cool library! It's made my coding experience so much easier since I no longer have to maintain my own block-chain of odd numbers to do the checks manually. I can only recommend this to anyone who likes odd numbers, or odd things just in general, or odd people like me. Would definitely buy again.

WOW! so enlightening!!!

## Buying an API key

Contacting me on my email ($1 fee) to tell me ($1 fee) that you want to buy an API key for ISODD:tm: ($500 license) is the best way to obtain a license for ISODD:tm: ($500 license). After an approval process of approximately two years (might be longer due to COVID-20 restrictions) an API key will be delivered to your door. (No need to give us your address, we harvested it from this page).

## Technical details

Some papers written by Intel leaked in 1492 (when CPUs were discovered) show that some incredibly complex numbers like `5` are exceedingly complicated for a CPU to figure out whether they are odd or not. That's why we connect to the internet using our HTTPS-based protocol called SPTTH that is up to 20 times faster than HTTPS to connect to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that calculates the result in 4 MICRASECONDES:tm: (not microseconds) instead of the 5 MICRASECONDES:tm: it would take your CPU to compute. You will need to use an API key for instant results, otherwise you will be ratelimited to 0 operations/year. We spend about 20 thousand lines in rolling out our own encryption algorithm and subset of the SSL protocol to ensure that there are no security holes in the connection and that your odd numbers do not get leaked.

There is an initial minimal loading time that the library uses to load a neural network to guess what numbers you will need to check if they are odd or not, so that it can download part of the 6 petabyte database in the arctic circle we keep (that keeps manually chosen results of a primitive is-odd function for every integer known to mathematicians) and give those results to you instantly. Machine learning has never been so useful!

## License

Fuck no! This is a PROPRIETARY product. The code is VERY licensed! Yes, you heard that right VERY licensed, EXTREMELY licensed. Do not copy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!one!!!!!
